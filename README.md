# Pandas Challenge
### A homework assignment from the University of Birmingham Data Analytics Bootcamp (November 2021)

The aim of this project was to create a [series of summary tables](https://github.com/J-Fairgrieve/pandas-challenge/blob/main/HeroesOfPymoli/HeroesOfPymoli.ipynb) using pandas from the 'Heroes of Pymoli' dataset. Analysis includes:
 - Player Count
 - Purchasing Analysis
 - Gender Demographics
 - Age Demographics
 - Top Spenders
 - Most Popular Items
 - Most Profitable Items

## Trends
### Gender Analysis
 - Males make up 84.03% of the total dataset, providing almost £2,000 of income from their purchases
 - However, females will spend more per head on average (£4.47 female spend per head vs £4.07 male spend per head)

### Age Analysis
 - The majority of spend comes from those aged 20-24; 44.79% of the total dataset. Other age groups with large proportions include 15-19 (18.58%) & 25-29 (13.37%)
 - This could suggest that Heroes of Pymoli players with the most disposable income for in-game transactions fall within these age groups

### Product Analysis
 - The most popular item to purchase in game is the 'Final Critic', purchased 13 times in this dataset
 - Because of this it also provides the highest value, bringing in £59.99 in sales throughout the period
